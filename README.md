# Overlook - A Hotel Management Page

## Abstract

This was a solo project involving building an application to use APIs to develop a hotel management website where users can log in, book a room, and see their current bookings. A manager can log in, search for a user, book a room for that user, and delete an upcoming booking for that user. 

## Setup

1. Clone down the repository.
2. Navigate into the project.
3. Run npm install.
4. Run npm test to see the tests pass.
5. Run npm start. You should see the message "Project is running at http://localhost:8080/". Copy or type the link into the browser to see the page in action!

## Resources

Used the [Webpack Starter Kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/webpack-starter-kit) from Turing.

## Future Plans

In the future, I would like to style the website more to make it look better while also still being accessible.
I would also like to create a user signup page so that new users can be instantiated, and have their passwords be variable.
